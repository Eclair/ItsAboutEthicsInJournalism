        "It's the newest sensation you might not have heard of: Minceraft. It's a game about building a raft out of meat $0, and it's sold 2 million copies in the last 4 months.",
        "Markus Humann, creator of Minceraft, is already well known for his hit game $1. Minceraft, however, is his first foray into meat-based games.",
        "\"I wanted to show my passion for $2,\" said Humann, 2014's International Swedish Meatball Eating Competition winner. Humann, however, has invited controversy with his political opinions."
        "Last month, he was forced to apologize for comments insulting to $3. But the kids who play Minceraft are more interested in the game than its creator.",
        "\"I made a raft out of $4 and it looked delicious,\" said Augustus Fleischmann, a 9-year-old avid Minceraft player."
