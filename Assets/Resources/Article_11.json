        "Fourth grade teacher Edna Futtlebutt, who may be $0, today assigned three hours of homework to her excellent students. ",
        "\"The little rats deserve it,\" students quoted Futtlebutt as saying while scratching the wart on her nose. \"I can't afford my yearly trip to $1 on my teacher's salary, and I'm going to make them pay for it.\"",
        "Students had a different perspective. \"I once saw her $2,\" said 10-year-old Jira Sakaguchi. \"I'm scared!\"",
        "At press time, Futtlebutt could not be reached for comment, as she $3."
